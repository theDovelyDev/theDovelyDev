# The Cloud Resume Challenge

I'm a Business Analyst at heart who fell in love with AWS technology. After I became a FinOps (Cloud Financial Mgmt) Practitioner, I decided to start learning thorugh projects while working my way through ACantril's course.

Some technologies I'm currenlty  working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. I can read code but can't write it.
