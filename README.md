## 👋 About Me

I started my tech career as a **Business Analyst in IT Infrastructure & Reliability**, where I fell in love with understanding complex systems and making them work better. That curiosity led me to cloud computing, where I discovered I could build tangible, production-grade systems without needing extra storage space in my house (a win for everyone involved).

Now I'm focused on **cloud engineering and data projects**, combining my analytical background with hands-on technical skills. I'm particularly interested in **AWS AI services**, **FinOps**, and building **cost-conscious, well-architected solutions**.

---

## 🎯 Why I Build

After earning my **AWS Cloud Practitioner certification**, I realized something: courses teach you theory, but **projects teach you reality**. I needed to bridge that gap between "I understand this concept" and "I can actually build this."

I'm a tactile learner—I like puzzles, building things with my hands, and figuring out how systems work by taking them apart and putting them back together. Cloud computing opened up an entirely new world where I could build something tangible, iterate on it, break it, fix it, and deploy it to production—all without finding storage space around my house.

**Every project in this repo represents something I built to learn**, not just to check a box. I document challenges, cost optimizations, and lessons learned because that's the real value—not just the final product.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🏆 Production Projects

#### [Cloud Resume Challenge](./cloudresumechallenge)

**My portfolio site built with AWS serverless architecture**  
Serverless frontend (S3 + CloudFront), API Gateway + Lambda backend, DynamoDB visitor counter, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, IaC with Terraform.  
**Tech:** AWS (S3, CloudFront, Lambda, DynamoDB, Route53), JavaScript, Python, Terraform  
🔗 [Live Site](https://www.theprojectfolder.com) | [GitHub](./cloudresumechallenge)

#### [Intelligent Document Processing Pipeline](./IDP_pipeline)

**AI-powered document extraction using AWS Textract and Comprehend**  
Event-driven Lambda function that automatically extracts text, entities, and sentiment from uploaded documents. Reduces processing time from 3 minutes to 30 seconds at $0.034 per document.  
**Tech:** AWS (Lambda, Textract, Comprehend, S3), Python, Event-Driven Architecture  
🔗 [GitHub](./IDP_pipeline) | [Article](link-when-published)

#### [DNS Failover with Route53](./route53-dns-failover)

**High availability architecture for static sites**  
Active/passive failover setup with health checks. Built in response to the December 2024 AWS us-east-1 outage—because downtime teaches the best lessons.  
**Tech:** AWS (Route53, S3, CloudFormation), High Availability, Disaster Recovery  
🔗 [GitHub](./route53-dns-failover)

## 💡 What Makes This Portfolio Different

**1. Cost-Conscious Engineering**  
Every project includes a cost tracker. I document AWS spend, optimize for Free Tier, and think about production costs from day one. FinOps isn't just a certification for me—it's a practice.

**2. Real Problems, Real Solutions**  
I don't build "toy projects." The DNS Failover project came from experiencing an actual AWS outage. The Document Processing Pipeline solves a real business problem (manual data entry). These are production-ready solutions.

**3. Learning in Public**  
I document challenges, failures, and pivots. The best learning happens when things break. I share those moments because that's where the real growth is.

**4. End-to-End Ownership**  
From architecture design to cost optimization to documentation—I own the full lifecycle. These aren't tutorials I followed; they're systems I designed, built, debugged, and deployed.
