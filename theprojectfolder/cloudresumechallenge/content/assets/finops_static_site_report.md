# FinOps Case Study: Static Website on AWS

## Overview

This FinOps case study analyzes the total cost of ownership and optimization opportunities for a static website architecture hosted entirely on AWS. The infrastructure serves a small to medium-scale workload with modest monthly visitor traffic.

## Infrastructure Summary

| Layer          | AWS Resources Used                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**   | Static HTML/CSS/JS hosted on Amazon S3              |
| **CI/CD**      | GitHub Actions with dry-run testing, fallback logic |
| **Storage**    | S3 with bucket policies (no ACLs)                   |
| **Networking** | CloudFront CDN, Route 53 DNS                        |
| **Serverless** | Lambda Function URL for visitor tracking            |
| **Database**   | DynamoDB (on-demand, TTL enabled)                   |
| **Monitoring** | S3 access logs, CloudWatch for Lambda               |
| **Security**   | IAM roles, least privilege policies, CORS headers   |

## Traffic Assumption

- **Baseline Load**: 2,500 visitors/month
- **Payload**: \~1MB per visitor
- **Lambda Execution**: 120ms x86, 128MB
- **Flat Costs**: Route 53, IAM roles

---

## Monthly Cost Estimation @ 2,500 Visitors



This chart breaks down AWS service costs before and after implementing cost optimization measures. Key actions include:

- Enabling S3 intelligent tiering
- Optimizing CloudFront cache policies
- Reducing DynamoDB read/write units
- Streamlining Lambda memory and execution time

---

## Annualized Cost Projection



The yearly projection demonstrates how small savings compound:

- Over \$50/year saved on CloudFront
- Over \$40/year saved on Lambda
- Nearly 20% overall reduction in total infrastructure cost

This diagram shows how each AWS service maps to a functional layer. Helps with stakeholder education and chargeback.

### üìâ Cost Optimization Impact (High-Traffic Scenario)



Based on 50,000 monthly visitors, this chart illustrates the maximum impact of FinOps practices under higher load.

---

## Summary & Insights

- AWS cost is predictable and scalable for static workloads.
- Optimization at even small scale (2,500 visitors/month) yields meaningful annual savings.
- Leveraging AWS Budgets and dashboards provides visibility and control.
- Flat services (like Route 53) are predictable, while variable services (like CloudFront, Lambda) benefit most from tuning.

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate this report into stakeholder dashboards
- Monitor real-time usage via CloudWatch
- Continue tracking cost anomalies with AWS Budgets
- Evaluate Reserved Capacity if traffic grows

## Stack by Stack Breakdown

- **Serverless backend**
  - ‚úÖ **FinOps**:
    - No idle capacity cost via `PAY_PER_REQUEST`
    - TTL reduces long-term storage
    - Lightweight x86 runtime for cheaper compute
- **Static frontend**
  - ‚úÖ **FinOps**:
    - S3 + CloudFront = ultra low cost delivery
    - No managed DNS = reduced monthly bill
- **Dedicated log storage bucket**
  - Lifecycle rule: logs expire after 60 days

  - Bucket policy: allows S3 logging from AWS

  - Parameterized via `LogBucketName`

  - ‚úÖ **FinOps**:

    - Prevents long-term log storage charges
    - Centralizes and simplifies access logging
- **Basic Observability**
  - **CloudWatch Alarm** on Lambda errors
  - No paid SNS or email integrations ‚Äî alerts sent via GitHub Actions/Slack
  - AWS Budgets are already configured
  - ‚úÖ **FinOps**:
    - No AWS-native alerting cost (Slack + GitHub notify)
    - Keeps observability minimal but effective

## ‚úÖ FinOps Highlights

Embedded into every template and decision:

- **Minimal runtime execution** (Lambda, DynamoDB, TTL)
- **Pay-as-you-go services** only
- **No premium AWS integrations** like Chatbot, SES, SNS
- **Lifecycle expiration policies** on log storage
- **Free alerting via GitHub & Slack integrations**
